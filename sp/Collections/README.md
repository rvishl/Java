## Types of Data Structure:
- Primitive Data Structure
    - boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, double.
- Non-Primitive Data Structure
    - Example are: String, Files, Arrays, Collections Framework (Collection, Map)

### Application of Arrays:
- Arrays are used to store multiple data with single variable name which reduces the number of variables to be declared.
- Arrays are used to develop some algorithms like Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort etc.
- Arrays can be used to perform matrix operations
- Arrays can be used for CPU scheduling.
- Arrays are used to implement data structure for example Stack, ArrayList, Queues etc.

## Point to remember for Array & Collection Framework:
- Array is java language feature inbuild support provided by sun Microsystems. We have to develop algorithms to sort or insert or delete etc.
    - Collection Framework are API feature. It predefined classes and interfaces and methods by which we can easily iterate, delete or sort the elements
- Array can store primitive(int, char, long) and non-primitive(objects) data types
    - Collection framework can store only non-primitive data types (objects).
- Arrays can store only homogeneous data types i.e. array can store only similar type of data.
    - Collection Framework can store hetrogeneous data i.e. We can store different type of data
- The size of an array cannot be increased or decreased according to our requirement at runtime.
    - The size of collection can be increased or decreased according to our needs
- Array are not good with respect to memory.
    - Collection framework are very good with respect to memory.
- Array are good by performance wise.
    - Collection are not good by performance wise.


## What is Collection Framework?
- Collection Framwork consists of 2 words i.e. Collection and Framework
    - Collection is a single entity or an object which contains multiple data.
    - Framework represents the library.
- Collection framework is the set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structure.
- Collection framework contains 2 main parts:
    - java.util.Collection
    - java.util.Map
- "9 key interfaces" of Collection Framework
    - java.util.Collection
        - Collection
        - List
        - Set
        - SortedSet
        - NavigableSet
        - Queue
    - java.util.Map
        - Map
        - SortedMap
        - NavigableMap
